**Resume Points:**
**Image Restoration using Wavelet Transform** | Image Processing

Instructor: Prof. Amit Sethi, Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay | Python (Sep’22 - Oct’22)

(a) Implemented soft & hard thresholding on discrete wavelet transform coefficients for denoising color images
degraded by AWGN and Gaussian blurring and obtained SSIM index of 94% and 97.5% respectively

(b) Further improved the SSIM score to 98.25% by using soft thresholding based on neighbourhood shrink

For verifying point (a) please see "Important Points" below question 3(c) in the colab notebook for SSIM index of 94%: Soft thresholding
For verifying point (a) please see "Important Points" below question 3(b) in the colab notebook for SSIM index of 97.5%: Hard thresholding

For verifying point (b) please see "Important Points" below question 3(d) in the colab notebook for SSIM index of 98.25%: Neighshrink method proposed by Chen et al
